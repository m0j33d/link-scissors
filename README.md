# LinkScissors (Express, React, Typescript, Mongo DB)

LinkScissors  is a web server application is built to shorten URLs ([see it here](https://github.com/m0j33d/link-scissors)), which is currently under development too.

### Links
- Live Site URL: [live link](https://link-scissors.onrender.com/)

### Scripts for testing

Make sure you have installed **Node.js (v16.15.3 or later recommended) which also comes with npm**.\
In the project directory, you can run in terminal:

```bash
 cd server && npm run dev 
 cd client && npm run start
```

Runs the app in the development mode and the server will reload when you make changes to the source code.

```bash
cd server && npm run build 
cd client && npm run build 

```

Builds the app for production to the **dist folder**.

```bash
npm cd server && run start
```

Builds and starts the server for prodution.

### Disclaimer

This application was made for pratice, learn and for improving my
coding skills only. Do not use this application for commercial or
professional purposes but you're free to test. Please understand that
all saved shortned urls are periodicaly deleted from the database to avoid higher server costs and that will lead them
to stop working.
